Beginning with a 7/10 knowledge of Python, along with starting a project in Python I also wanted to build a portfolio for myself, having never done so before. 
Coming from an electronics background, I never picked up on web development, so with this portfolio I will be starting from scratch. I'll begin with building a simple, static
portfolio using the fundamentals of frontend: HTML, CSS and Javascript. As I master these 3, I'll eventually move on to more complex frameworks and ultimately set up a whole backend
for a complete, dynamic and beautiful portfolio.
