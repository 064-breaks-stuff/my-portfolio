📚Beginning with a 7/10 knowledge of Python, along with starting a project in Python I also wanted to build a portfolio for myself, having never done so before. 
Coming from an electronics background, I never picked up on web development, so with this portfolio I will be starting from scratch. I'll begin with building a simple, static
portfolio using the fundamentals of frontend: HTML, CSS and Javascript. As I master these 3, I'll eventually move on to more complex frameworks and ultimately set up a whole backend
for a complete, dynamic and beautiful portfolio. 

🎯My (current) overall aim for how my portfolio should look is:

- an about section
- a section that displays my profiles (LinkedIn, Hackerrank, Github for now)
- a section that displays my top projects sorted by domain/industry
- a section that displays any research papers I've published/contributed to
- a section that displays my current research paper interest
- a section that displays my technical skills sorted by domain/industry
- a section that displays my experiences with a brief write-up of my work
- a section that highlights my services (consultant/freelancer) along with an overview of the tech stacks I bring along
- a section that highlights the employment I'm looking for (full-time), along with an overview of my tech stacks and my compatibility with the role
- a link to download my CV

(subject to future additions or deletions)
